<h2>A WORD ABOUT JULES</h2>

<p>This story of Jules Turnour interests me more
than I can say. I have known him for more than
twenty years; have seen him at very close range in
all the shifting movement of a great circus
organization, and I have yet to find a man with a
cleaner, higher aim. Mr. Marcosson, I think, has
admirably brought out the contrast between his
whitened and motley face and his patient, serious
purpose to make his life helpful. The world has
been made better by the presence and work of
Jules, and I am glad that at last the real story
of his somewhat unusual career is now told.</p>

<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>When the article on which this little book
is based appeared in the <i>Saturday Evening
Post</i> we were amazed at the response it
evoked. It simply proved that all the
world loves a clown. In most of the comment
and communication, however, there
was a question as to the authenticity of the
subject. I beg to say that Jules is a real
personage and still the nimble producer of
many laughs.</p>

<p>It was while writing a series of articles
on an entirely different phase of the circus
that I first met Jules. I heard of him the
moment I stepped into the circus world.
So thoroughly had he impressed his personality;
so deeply had he become at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>tached
to its life, and so profoundly had he
gained the respect of its people, that not
to have heard of him argued that I was
deaf and blind to everything about me. I
found him the friend, philosopher, and
guide of the nomadic city of tents that
rose with the dawn and slipped away into
the night. Despite its transiency, there was
much permanency of character in its varied
inhabitants. No one contributed more to
its moral structure than Jules, the clown.</p>

<p>We who live in this breathless era are
wont to look upon the circus as a temporary
amusement makeshift. It is here to-day
and gone to-morrow. Yet behind its
spangled, tinseled array and restless movement
are real traditions. Why has the circus
endured in an age that craves new
diversion? Simply because it is basic; because
it fills a fundamental need; because
it is a staple like wheat. Laughter is one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
of the few eternal things; therefore the
circus which produces it takes on something
of the same quality. More than this, the
circus is as much an expression of art as
the drama. Like art, it is universal. The
clown being a world citizen interprets a
world humor in which there is neither
border line, race, nor creed. Most of the
great humorists have been sad men, and thus
the clown, clothed in his right mind, is
grave and reflective. Though he wear cap
and bells, he has not wanted for recognition
among the great. Garrick, Kemble,
and Booth have been glad to claim him as
fellow-artists. But it is in the heart of
the child that he has found his most grateful
friend, and in a larger sense all the
world is a child when it goes to the circus.</p>

<p>In my work I have had to be, on many
occasions, the biographer of the great and
the chronicler of much timely achievement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
In all this swift march of people and events
I have yet to meet a man whose devotion to
the ideals of his art is more sincere than that
which has animated Jules Turnour through
the long years of his clowning. I have
been with him in the tumult of tented
travel and watched him in the roofed
arena before the multitudes. Always I
have found him proud to be a clown. To
know him has indeed been a liberal education
in character and loyalty.</p>

<p class="center"><big>THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY
OF A CLOWN</big></p>

<hr />

<h2>I<br /><br />

I AM BORN IN A CIRCUS WAGON</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> <big>SUPPOSE</big> it was destiny that I
should be a clown because I was born
in a circus wagon. It happened in this
way. My mother had been a premi&egrave;re
dancer on the French and English stage
and had appeared in many of the great
Covent Garden and Drury Lane Christmas
pantomimes, but she grew stout, which is
always fatal to that kind of dancing. She
did not want to leave my father, who was
also a dancer and general acrobat, so they
invested their savings in a small circus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>In those days&#8212;it was more than fifty
years ago&#8212;Europe was alive with small
circuses; most of them very modest, but all
furnishing a very popular form of amusement.
There were few, if any, theaters
scattered throughout the country. Only
city folk could enjoy the benefits and pleasures
of plays. It followed that the great
mass of the country people flocked to the
circus, and the coming of one of them was
an event. Often the circus showed in a
large inclosure built for meetings and public
entertainments. There was no top to
the structure and in case of rain the people
either went home or ran the risk of spoiling
their clothes for the privilege of remaining.
The shows traveled from town to
town in wagons, much smaller but not unlike
the big red creaking wagons of the
modern American circus.</p>

<p>Up to that time the menagerie was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
considered necessary to the circus, but it
was good business to have at least one cage
with a wild beast in it. My mother&#8217;s circus
had a performing lion who was a sort
of patriarch. He was so amiable that he
would eat out of the hand of a child and
he was so gentle that he had to be prodded
into a roar. The circus bill included several
acrobatic acts, a juggler, a sleight-of-hand
worker, and the faithful lion who
was both useful and ornamental. My
mother, who was as clever in business as she
had been with her toes, managed the show
and my father was the principal performer.
It was a happy-go-lucky life,
this wandering from town to town, in the
pleasant sunshine by day and under the
stars by night.</p>

<p>During the year so fateful to me our
little show had traveled through the south
of France and made its way into Spain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
On a clear, hot July Sunday we reached
Galicia and camped on the edge of a wood.
It was there that I was born. My mother
and father cooked, ate, and slept in one of
the wagons which was for years the traveling
home of the family. My mother always
told me that the first thing I saw
when my little eyes gazed out of the wagon
was old Albro, the French clown, who sat
in the sun whitening his face for the afternoon
performance. More than once my
baby cries mingled with the rude jests he
hurled at the audiences. He was often my
nurse and he told me wonderful stories of
his travels in foreign countries. I toddled
about the wagons and often slept
under the very hoofs of the horses. When
I cried late at night my mother would take
me out near the lion&#8217;s cage and tell me
that the old fellow would come out and roar
if I did not stop. I never cried during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
performances, but lay in my little bed in
the wagon charmed by the music. I was,
in truth, a child of the circus.</p>

<p>As I grew older I became a problem.
The circus grew larger and my mother
was so much occupied with the details of
its management that she had little time for
me. A nurse with the show was out of
the question. So I was sent to Lisbon,
where my father had relatives. I remember
very little of my early childhood there.
The circus scenes are much more vivid. I
do recall that my nurse told me many
times that I was to be a circus performer
when I grew up. That of course pleased
me. In the winters, when the little show
was packed away and the old lion rented
out to a menagerie in Toulon, my father
and mother came to see me. On my fifth
birthday I got my first lesson in the alphabet.
Instead of teaching me the word cat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
the old nurse taught me how to spell lion.
You see I knew all about lions and very little
about cats.</p>

<p>My parents were very thrifty. It is the
French habit. It is, or was, part of the
old unwritten French circus law, that as
soon as a child was strong enough to stand
on his hands he must be put out to work.
Likewise it is a tradition that the name
of a family in a circus must be carried on
by the children and by their children&#8217;s children.
It followed that when I was six
years old my father came one January day
and took me to London. On the way there
he told me that the time had come when
I should begin my career. I was only six,
but to this day I recall my father&#8217;s words.</p>

<p>When we got to London it was wet and
cold and I was afraid. I hardly knew my
father, we had been separated so long. We
went to a small hotel much frequented by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
circus and theatrical people. My father
was known to most of them, and more than
one big broad-shouldered man clapped me
on the shoulder so hard that it hurt. In
those days the circus people were rude and
a hard lot, and they thought I was as tough
as they were.</p>

<p>The very night that we reached London
a brawny, red-faced man came to see my
father at the hotel. I recall that he was
addressed as &#8220;Mr. Conrad.&#8221; I had a sort
of shiver when he came into the room. It
was curious, too, how he should have affected
me, for he was destined to play a
very important part in my life. He and
my father talked a long time. Every once
in a while I heard my name mentioned.
Finally the man came over to me, picked
me up in one hand (he was a giant in
strength), and flung me up in the air.
He caught me easily and then let me slide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
to the floor. After he left my father
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Jules, henceforth you are to live with
that man. He is to be your father and your
teacher. Be a good boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he told me that I had been apprenticed
to the Conrads, who were a famous
acrobatic family. The following day my
father took me to another hotel where the
Conrads were living, for they were performing
in the Hippodrome, and he went back
to Spain to join my mother. I had made a
start in the big business of life and I felt
very lonesome.</p>

<p>Perhaps I had better explain right here
just what being apprenticed to an acrobatic
&#8220;family&#8221; means. The same thing has gone
on in Europe for a hundred years and will
go on as long as acrobats keep up their
work. Every great group of performers
that you see in the circus or elsewhere, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
matter if they perform on the flying trapeze,
tumble, or ride on bicycles or on horseback,
is called a &#8220;family.&#8221; They may be known
as the Sensational Sellos or the Marvelous
Revellis. Now the interesting thing about
it is that they are not real families at all.
They develop into groups simply because
they take in young apprentices, train and
develop them, and make them part of their
troupes. Six or seven real families may
be represented in one circus &#8220;family.&#8221;</p>

<p>The head of the &#8220;family&#8221; is always the
biggest man of the lot. In circus or acrobatic
speech he is known as the &#8220;under-stander,&#8221;
because literally he stands at the
bottom of the act, as for example in the
human pyramid, and holds up all the rest.
He must be broad, strong, and powerful in
every way. He makes all the contracts,
receives all moneys, and is the general manager
of the combination. The Conrads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
were a very well-known &#8220;family&#8221; and
much in demand for circuses all over the
Continent and England. Shortly after I
became a member of the Conrads the London
engagement ended and we went to the
famous Circus Rentz in Berlin.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i029.jpg" width="500" height="336" alt="" />
<p class="center">&#8220;EVERY STEP IN THE MAKING OF A CLOWN IS HARD WORK.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>I was given to understand at the start
that Mr. Conrad was my boss in all things.
He was to provide me with food and
clothes and shelter. He controlled my
time and my actions day and night. He
was not long in beginning my training.
We practiced in the rooms of the hotels
or boarding houses where we stopped or in
the arenas in the morning before the performance
began.</p>


<p>The Conrads were what is known as
&#8220;carpet gymnasts,&#8221; which means that they
worked on the ground and not in the air.
It was decided that I should begin as a
contortionist because they needed one in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>new act they were preparing. I began by
practicing what is known in the profession
as posturing. This consists of bending
back and forth. In order to be a good contortionist
you must be a good &#8220;bender,&#8221;
that is, bend so close that the two extremes
of your body meet. While many people
may be born supple, it does not follow
that they can become good contortionists,
save by long and constant training. Every
day one of the Conrads took me by the
arms and another took me by the feet and
bent me back and forth. It was very hard
and painful and often I cried. Then one
of my teachers would jeer at me and say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Only babies cry. Be a man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sometimes I thought I should die from
weariness and ache. But as I grew more
supple and could bend more closely I began
to take a pride in my work. The Conrads
encouraged this pride and relented far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
enough to say a kind word when I showed
particular signs of progress.</p>

<p>By the time I was eight years of age I
was considered a good contortionist. Long
before that time I had appeared in public.
I was first used as a sort of human baseball
in family acts. I was tossed from
shoulder to shoulder. At other times I
became a spinning wheel. One of the
Conrads would lie on his back, lift me to the
soles of his feet, and then whirl me around.
At first it made me dizzy, but I came to
like it because the people applauded. It is
easy to succumb to the flattery of the
crowd and to love the music of clapping
hands. You never get enough of it in the
circus business.</p>

<p>In addition to my training as contortionist
I was being trained as gymnast. I
was taught the forward somersault first.
I wore a belt with a ring on each side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Stout cords were passed through these
rings. With a Conrad on each side holding
the cords which acted as an axis I was
whirled around. Soon I was able to turn
without their help. Then I learned the back
somersault in the same way. This constant
work hardened my muscles and I became
like steel. All the while we were traveling
over Europe, visiting the circuses of the
great capitals. But I saw little of the cities
or their life. It was work or training all
day and half the night and then to bed,
for the acrobat must have his rest and lots
of sleep.</p>

<p>My first public appearance alone followed
soon after I became a skilled contortionist.
I was heralded as a &#8220;Child
Wonder&#8221; and I did what was known as
&#8220;The Demon Act.&#8221; I wore red tights,
reddened my face, wore a little tail, and
looked like a real little devil. I shall never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
forget my initial appearance. It was in a
huge London music hall. When I came
out everybody applauded because I must
have been a fearful sight. Every seat
seemed to be filled, the band played, and it
was a wonderful feeling. I forgot, for the
moment, all the hardship and traveling I
had endured; the cold, the hunger, and the
separation from my parents. All that I
realized was that a great, new, animated
world was spread before me and that all
eyes were upon me. My act was simple
contortion work, but the effective red costume
seemed to make a hit and I was recalled
several times. Henceforth I did this
act twice a day for a year. When I got
through each time I had to change my
clothes, put on flesh-colored tights, and do
my share of work with the whole Conrad
family.</p>

<p>My apprenticeship to the Conrads lasted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
ten years, the original term of the indenture.
During that time I received no pay. I
don&#8217;t think that in all that period I had as
much as a pound to spend on myself.
Meanwhile the Conrads had received good
money for my appearance, especially for
the &#8220;Demon Act.&#8221; But I must say I
learned a lot from them despite the fact
that they were hard taskmasters.</p>

<p>On the day I was sixteen years of age
my slavery ended. The contract with the
Conrads was up and I was free. The
Conrads wanted me to stay with them, but
I had too many scars on my back, too
vivid a memory of cold, half-fed nights and
long days of relentless practicing. I
wanted to go out in the world for myself,
and I went.</p>

<p>At the Circus Francisco in Paris I met
a young apprentice, a fine young German
lad. We had sympathized with each other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
and, boy-like, had made a sort of pact that
as soon as we got out of bondage we would
form a team. &#8220;Who knows,&#8221; I had said,
&#8220;some day we may have a &#8216;family&#8217; of our
own.&#8221; His term of apprenticeship ended
with mine; I had his address, so we met in
London. He was a good contortionist,
having gone through the same rigorous
training that I had, and we had little trouble
in getting an engagement together. At
one time we had four engagements at the
same time in London. We had to go from
music hall to music hall in cabs, and often
we did not have time to change clothes.
We were making twenty pounds a week
apiece, which is pretty good money for boys
barely seventeen. I sent most of my money
home to my mother. The circus had failed
and she was living in Paris. My father had
died in the meantime. You may wonder
perhaps how a boy of my tender years was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
able to take care of himself. But if my
years were tender, my back and muscles
were hard. Life, too, was hard. I had
been raised in a stern school, and it made
for independence.</p>

<p>After a year of freedom I became ill.
One day I collapsed during my contortion
act. I went to a hospital and the doctor
told me that I could not work for years.
I could hardly believe it, but he said that
I had worked so hard that I had strained
myself. To make this unhappy chapter of
my life short, I was in and out of a hospital
for three years.</p>

<p>When I came out I felt weak, but the
first thing I did was to try some of my old
contortion tricks. But there was a great
wrench in my back and a sharp pain shot
all through my body. The cold sweat broke
out all over me. I tried again, and with
the same result. Then I realized what had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
happened. I had become stiff, and my
days as contortionist were over. I was
barely twenty years old, and yet I had lived
a whole lifetime of work and denial. What
was I to do?<br /><br /></p>

<h2>II<br /><br />

I BECOME A CLOWN</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> <big>FOUND</big> that I could still do some
acrobatic tricks like simple flip-flaps.
You can never possibly realize the feeling
of consolation that came to me when I
landed on my feet after the first experimental
turn, for, with that landing, I realized
that I still had a means of earning a
livelihood. It was like a man who suddenly
found an arm useful that had been considered
helpless. I had been a good balancer
in my contortion days, and this was
also an asset. So I joined a troupe known
as &#8220;Jackley&#8217;s Wonders,&#8221; which started for
a tour of Northern Africa with Brachini&#8217;s
circus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>But my joy over finding the relic of my
gymnastic power was short-lived. Even the
most ordinary acrobatic work began to tell
on me. Every night when the circus day
was ended, I suffered the most intense
pains. My back became weak. I was in
despair.</p>

<p>One day the ringmaster, to whom I
had told my physical troubles, said to
me:</p>

<p>&#8220;Jules, you are a good mimic. Why
don&#8217;t you try clowning?&#8221;</p>

<p>It struck me as a very good idea. I had
always been interested in clowns. Their
drolleries and fooling had won my child
heart, and I could never forget those early
kindnesses of the old clown Albro, my first
nurse, who was with my mother&#8217;s circus.
Often during the harsh days of my apprenticeship
I would steal away after training
and watch the clowns at work or play.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
They told me stories, but, to my great surprise,
they were never funny stories, and I
now recall my first sense of surprise over
finding the clowns such serious, sober men
when they were away from the circus. I
had watched them very carefully, and I had
an instinct that I was going to succeed as
one of them.</p>

<p>To be a good clown, even then, a man
had to be a pretty good acrobat, because in
his clowning he was called upon to do many
arduous physical things. The clowns in
those days were what was known as &#8220;talking&#8221;
clowns. They talked as they worked.
The circuses were much smaller than now,
and it was not difficult to get and hold the
interest and attention of the people. One
of the clowns&#8217; favorite occupations was to
guy the ringmaster. He would engage him
in conversation something like this:</p>

<p>&#8220;I hear you are a great traveler.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the ringmaster would reply with
great dignity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ever been to Rome?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Been to Paris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the clown would ask if he had been
to various other cities, to which the ringmaster
would keep on making the reply
&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then the clown would glibly ask:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ever been to jail?&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereupon the ringmaster would pretend
to fall into the trap and say &#8220;Yes,&#8221;
at which the crowd roared with laughter.
This may seem to be rude humor to you,
but the circus crowds in the foreign provinces
were composed of rude people of the
middle and lower classes, and they thought
this kind of horse-play was great fun.</p>

<p>My first appearance as clown is a very
vivid recollection. It was in the circus at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Oran, in North Africa. I had, in my day,
done many hazardous acrobatic feats and it
was a daily matter for me to risk my neck
in some kind of performance. I could do it,
too, without turning a hair. But when I
came out in my white face before a great
crowd I was nervous. I had a good make-up,
however, and the people laughed as
soon as they saw me. Laughter has a
peculiar effect. If it ripples out as soon
as you appear, you may be sure that you
are succeeding, because if the people do
not think you even look funny, they will not
laugh. My nervousness in clowning soon
wore off.</p>

<p>As I came to study clowning I found
that it was a serious and difficult business.
Every step in the making of a clown or
the manufacture of his &#8220;business&#8221; is hard
work. To produce laughs you must make a
serious effort. You may have noticed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
nearly every clown makes a practice of
falling down in various absurd and ridiculous
ways. Even this business of making a
fall requires the most elaborate kind of
preparation. It may look very easy to
take a tumble in the sawdust, but I assure
you it is only done after long practice.
Every step of it must be rehearsed. Unless
the funny fall is natural, it fails utterly.</p>

<p>The tall, peaked hat was a great aid to
the clown in my early days of clowning.
I do not know the origin of it, save that it
probably descended from the original fool&#8217;s
cap. I used to come out with seven of these
peaked hats piled up on my head. Then I
would take them off, throw them up in the
air, one by one, and catch them on my head.
This always made a great hit. In those
days the circus, being small, only had one
clown, and he had to do a good deal of
work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>To be a successful clown you had also to
be a good pantomimist, because all clowning
is really based on the pantomime. This
enabled the clown to get an engagement on
the variety stage during the winter and
closed circus season.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I had been traveling all over
Europe, first with one circus and then another.
My work as clown developed. Of
course, in passing from one country to the
other I picked up the different Continental
languages. This was highly important, because
I had often to carry on a sort of
running conversation with the spectators.</p>

<p>Like every other circus performer I had
many escapes from death. My body and
arms were soon covered with scars, each one
a souvenir of some accident. At the Circus
Cliniselli in Berlin I was knocked down
by a horse, which walked on my face. One
hoof laid my cheek open. The crowd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
thought it was part of the show, and
laughed, while I suffered tortures, not
knowing what the animal would do next.</p>

<p>At St. Petersburg I was doing a clown
leaping act over a row of horses, when the
springboard slipped and I landed on my
head. I was taken out for dead, but in a
few days I was all right again and back at
my work.</p>

<p>It was while I was performing at the
Cirque d&#8217;Et&eacute; in Paris that I witnessed a
sight that made a profound impression on
me. In the circus was a dashing rider named
M. Prince. He was a great favorite and his
appearance was always greeted by tremendous
applause. He did a somersault on
horseback. One day he slipped, fell on his
head, and lay still. An attendant ran forward,
covered him with a blanket, and carried
him off. At that moment the ringmaster
took off his hat and announced:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;It is nothing, ladies and gentlemen; a
very slight accident. M. Prince begs the
public will excuse him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then we clowns leaped into the arena
and made merry, and the circus went on.
The truth of the matter was that M.
Prince&#8217;s neck had been broken by the fall
and that he had died instantly. So swift
and sure is the circus man&#8217;s desire not to
divert the interest of the crowd that there
was absolutely no hint of the tragedy that
had happened before the very eyes of everybody.</p>

<p>About this time I joined what was called
the Schumann Combination, a half circus
and half variety show. We had acrobats,
jugglers, singers, dancers, a clown, and a
marvelous sword swallower named Maldini.
He was the greatest artist of his kind I ever
saw. He could run a bayonet and part
of a gun-barrel down his throat. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
very keen and resourceful, too, as you shall
see.</p>

<p>We went on an elaborate tour, and
reached Mexico. There we played many
small towns. It was hard traveling, for
Mexico was a rude country with few
cities. We had to journey by donkey and
by stage; the roads were bad and the land
infested with brigands. All the men in our
troupe were heavily armed.</p>

<p>One night we stopped at a small inn and
took a much-needed rest. Before we departed
the next morning the innkeeper
warned us about the danger of crossing a
certain narrow mountain road. The innkeeper
said that we were very liable to
be held up by brigands.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; he added, &#8220;if a man appears at
the top of the ca&ntilde;on and waves his hat at
you, you are safe.&#8221;<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i051.jpg" width="400" height="541" alt="" />
<p class="center">&#8220;THE TALL PEAKED HAT WAS A GREAT AID TO CLOWNING.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Being a sword swallower, Maldini was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>the nearest thing to a real soldier or fighting
man that we had, so, by unanimous
vote, he was placed in command of the expedition.
As we approached the narrow
pass we saw men concealed in the bushes.
Maldini halted us, gave orders to prepare
our weapons in a loud voice, and then
added:</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire fast and die bravely.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he stepped forward and pulled
from a sheath one of the huge swords that
he used in his sword-swallowing act. After
testing its keenness by running the blade
over his finger, he struck a fine dramatic
pose, and rammed the sword down his
throat again and again. It was a curious
and unforgettable picture; the sword swallower
out on that rocky ledge in the early
morning light, with the great mountains all
around. He was literally swallowing for
dear life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a wild country, and the people
were very superstitious. They had never
seen a sword swallower before. Therefore,
as Maldini did his act out in the open we
could hear the brigands fairly gasping in
wonderment and awe. In a few moments
one of them arose, waved his hat with trembling
hand, and we passed through the
danger zone safely. The sword-swallowing
act had probably saved our lives, and we
showered praise and congratulation upon
Maldini. This incident determined my
future course. I had found my work hard
enough, but I did not want physical hardship
increased by outside menace. I had
all the perils I wanted in my work, so I
decided to leave at the very first opportunity.
In those days we had no written
contracts, and the performers could leave
whenever they got ready.</p>

<p>We traveled through Mexico and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
of the Central American countries. Finally
we reached the Pacific coast. The Combination
was headed for South America
and wanted me to go along, but I
declined. I was in the New World, and
I wanted to see something of it. Besides,
my mother had come to New York to live.
She had married for the second time, her
new husband being a manufacturer of fireworks.</p>

<p>I took the first boat for San Francisco.
It gave me a sort of thrill to step ashore
there, for the United States had always
beckoned to me. I felt that there could
be no hardship here. The land was
smiling and the sky was as blue as
Italy&#8217;s.</p>

<p>I crossed the continent to New York
and went straight to my mother&#8217;s. She
lived in a little flat on Third Avenue. You
must remember that I had not seen her for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
nineteen years. Almost tremblingly I
mounted the steps and rang the bell at
her door. It seemed an age before the
knob turned and the door opened. In the
doorway I saw a stout woman, who stared
at me curiously. I saw that she did not
recognize me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you and what do you want?&#8221;
she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know me?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>The woman looked steadily at me, and
said slowly:</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>It gave me a deep wrench.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am your boy Jules,&#8221; I said. She
gave a cry and fell on my neck. Then
she almost carried me into the room and
made me sit on her lap. She caressed my
face, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You have changed a great deal.
Where is your soft, silky hair that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
had as a boy, and what has become of your
beautiful complexion?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sadly enough my circus life had played
havoc with whatever tenderness and softness
I once had in my face. The Red
Rattle, as the paint I had used in the
Demon Act is called, had left marks on my
face. Besides, pain and hardship had put
their indelible impress in lines and wrinkles.
The close-fitting caps that I had to wear as
clown had made my hair thin and coarse.</p>

<p>But I was glad to be back even in the
pretense of a home. I inquired eagerly of
my sisters. One of them, Millie, had become
a great balancing trapeze artist, and
was with the Forepaugh circus. Another
sister, Jennie, was a noted bareback rider
with the Sells show; my brother Tom had
developed into a famous acrobat and pantomimist,
and was with the Hanlons. I felt
proud of all of them. They had done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
honor and dignity to the family&#8217;s circus
name, and maintained its best traditions.
I alone felt that it was up to me to do something
great in my line.</p>

<p>I wanted to remain near my mother for a
little while, so I went on as juggler at a
variety show on the Bowery, which was then
the most famous amusement highway in
New York. But the call of the circus was
always in my ears. When once you have
tasted of its sensations they never die. I
played the part of a Spanish clown in a
circus at Havana, and then returned to the
United States, this time to stay.</p>

<h2>III<br /><br />

I JOIN THE TENTED CIRCUS</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">D</span><big>URING</big> all these years that I had
spent clowning in various lands, that
peculiarly American institution, the tented
circus, had been rapidly developing. The
first circus to show under a &#8220;canvas top&#8221;
had unfolded its wonders in New England
as far back as 1826. Previous to that time
the circuses had showed in frame buildings,
theaters, or in hotel yards behind canvas
walls under the sky. The first shows had
no menageries. When the showmen did
begin to acquire animals from the sea captains
who brought them to America in a
spirit of speculation, the menagerie was a
separate and distinct institution. The ani<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>mals
had a strong drawing power, and were
only exhibited in the daytime. This enabled
the showmen to attract people on
Sunday. It was not until 1851 that the
circus and the menagerie were exhibited at
the same time for one price of admission.</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem to you who are
accustomed to seeing elephants, the first one
brought to this country produced a profound
sensation. I have heard the old
showmen talk of it very often. It was not
attached to a circus, but was exhibited in
barns during the day. At night it was
taken from town to town, swathed in
blankets, so curious country people could
not get a free glimpse of it. Sadly enough,
this elephant was shot by some miscreant,
who wanted to see if a bullet would pierce
his thick hide.</p>

<p>In Europe we had heard various kinds
of reports about the American circus from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
performers who had gone over. Some
seemed incredible. It was said that the
shows in this country had hundreds of
horses and as many attendants. This seemed
so huge alongside our smaller Continental
circuses that I refused to believe it. But
when I did come over and saw an American
circus in all its glory I realized that half of
the truth about it had not been told. When
I came back from Havana the old circus
kings were coming into their own. W. C.
Coup, probably the father of the modern
traveling circus, had the &#8220;United Monster
Shows&#8221; out. He lured P. T. Barnum from
the museum business to the circus game,
and they formed what was undoubtedly
the first great combination of showmen.
&#8220;Yankee&#8221; Robinson, who had been a circus
autocrat as far back as the sixties,
the Sells Brothers, Adam Forepaugh, the
Mabies, Dan Costello, and John Robinson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
all had shows on the road, and were getting
bigger and stronger all the time. It was
about that time that the Ringling Brothers
were having their first circus thrills, and
were laying the foundation of a knowledge
and experience that have made them leaders
of their world to-day.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i063.jpg" width="400" height="557" alt="" />
<p class="center">&#8220;TO PRODUCE LAUGHS YOU MUST MAKE A SERIOUS EFFORT.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>All the circuses then were wagon shows.
They traveled from town to town in
wagons. The performers went ahead to the
hotel in &#8217;buses or snatched what sleep they
could in specially built vans. The start
for the next town was usually made about
three o&#8217;clock in the morning. No &#8220;run&#8221;
from town to town was more than twenty
miles, and more often it was considerably
less. At the head of the cavalcade rode
the leader, on horseback, with a lantern.
Torches flickered from most of the wagons,
and cast big shadows. The procession of
creaking vehicles, neighing horses, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>sometimes roaring beasts was an odd picture
as it wound through the night. Many
of the drivers slept on their seats. The
elephant always walked majestically, with
a sleepy groom alongside. The route was
indicated by flaming torches left at points
where the roads turned. Sometimes these
torches went out, and the show got lost.
More than once a farmer was rudely
aroused from his slumbers, and nearly lost
his wits when he poked his head out of his
window and saw the black bulk of an elephant
in his front yard. It was, indeed, the
picturesque day of the circus.</p>

<p>My first engagement was with the Burr
Bobbins circus, which was a big wagon
show. The night traveling in the wagons
was new to me, and at first strange. But
I got to like it very much. It was a great
relief to lie in the wagons, out under the
stars, and feel the sweet breath of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
country. Often the nights were so still
that the only sounds were the creaking of
the wagons, and occasionally the words,
&#8220;Mile up,&#8221; that the elephant driver always
used to urge on his patient, plodding beast.</p>

<p>The circus arrangement then was much
different from now. Then the whole outfit
halted outside the town, which was never
reached until after daylight. The canvas
men would hurry to the &#8220;lot&#8221; to put up
the tents while we remained behind to
spruce up for the parade. Gay flags were
hoisted over the dusty wagons; the tired
and sleepy performers turned out of tousled
beds to put on the finery of the Orient. A
gorgeous howdah was placed on the elephant&#8217;s
back, and a dark-eyed beauty, usually
from some eastern city, was hoisted
aloft to ride in state, and to be the
envy and admiration of every village
maiden. No matter how long, wet, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
dusty had been our journey from the last
town, everybody, man and beast, always
braced up for the parade. Of course, by
this time, we were surrounded by a crowd
of gaping countrymen. Often the triumphant
parade of the town was made on
empty stomachs, for there was to be no letup
until the people of the community had
had every bit of &#8220;free doing&#8221; that the circus
could supply. The clowns always drove
mules in the parade. When the parade
reached the grounds, the performers
changed clothes, hastened back to the village
hotel, and ate heartily. If there was
time, we snatched a few hours of sleep.
But sleep and the circus man are strangers
during the season. Ask any circus man
when he sleeps, and he will say, &#8220;In the
winter time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, as now and always, the clown was
a very important part of the circus. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
could hear the people all up and down the
village streets asking: &#8220;Where are the
clowns?&#8221; and when we hove into sight there
would be a clapping of hands and the exchange
of jests and words. During that
first engagement with the Burr Robbins
show I was what was called a &#8220;talking and
knockabout clown.&#8221; I have had many odd
experiences, but none more memorable than
my first appearance under canvas in America.
I felt as if I had been transported to
a different show world and was moving and
breathing under a sea of canvas. The arena
was much bigger than those of the European
circuses, and I found that you had to
strain every effort to be seen and heard and
appreciated.</p>

<p>I found, among other things, that the
average American circus-goer was not so
responsive to the clown as the European
frequenter of the arena. One reason for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
this is that the average American, even in
the smaller towns, has more diversions than
his foreign cousin. Besides, Europe had
seen many generations of clowns, and had
witnessed the whole evolution of his art.
The American had to be educated up to
him.</p>

<p>I stayed with the Robbins show for a
number of years. I found the wagon life
very alluring. There was an odd sort of
democracy among the circus people. I
found various countrymen of mine, for the
average circus performer is a great nomad.
In those days there was fierce and costly
rivalry between circuses. It often led to
open combat. I have heard that on one
occasion one showman burned up a bridge
in order to keep a competitor from reaching
the next town. Often there was hostility
on the part of the natives. The circus
man then had to be a fighter in self<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>defense.
The phrase &#8220;Hey, Rube!&#8221; had
been born. This has been, for many years,
the battle-cry of the showmen. It is the
call to arms and for help, and I have heard
it ring out on dark nights, and the next
moment found myself in the center of a
struggling, fighting mob.</p>

<p>When I joined out with the Robbins
show, however, some of the costly competition
of the fighting kind had subsided, although
the circus business was fraught with
much hardship. Fires, cyclones, and wrecks
were the chief dangers. The menagerie
then was exhibited in the tent where the
big show was given. In case of fire, the
animals often got loose. Once, when I was
out on the track, I was horrified to see a
leopard that had escaped from his cage.
He crouched in the sawdust. A troupe of
bronchos was in the ring. The wild beast
hesitated a moment, then sprang through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
the air, and alighted on the back of one of
the horses. The animal was stiff with fear.
Suddenly I heard a commotion in the
seats, and a tipsy countryman made his
way to the ring. Before any of the people
could move, he had seized a whip and begun
lashing the leopard. He was big and
strong, and he rained blows on the animal.
Soon it began to whimper and before long
was groveling in the sawdust, where it was
taken in charge by the trainer, who had
arrived by this time.</p>

<p>It did not take me long to find out that
to be a successful clown in America you
had to make local hits, just the way comedians
did on the stage. The tents were
not nearly so large as they are now and you
could talk to your audience and be readily
understood. Accordingly, I made haste, as
soon as I reached a town, to get a local
newspaper, find out what was going on, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
then I made a reference to it in my clowning.
It never failed to please the spectators.</p>

<p>I was very much impressed with the
United States, for we were traveling all the
time. Down South I was much interested in
the negroes who flocked to the circus. They
would spend their last cent to get in. They
were very superstitious, and when we did
sleight-of-hand tricks or fancy falls, they
stared with big eyes. Some even got scared
and left the tent.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="center">&#8220;BEHIND THE JESTS OF THE CLOWN IS THE SEAR OF
SORROW.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The negro lived in deadly fear of the
escape of the wild animals. One of the
favorite jokes of the advance brigade of the
circus, and by this is meant the men who go
ahead and do the billing, was to tell the
negroes that a den of lions and tigers had
escaped, and were prowling through the
country. However, this gave the negro a
good excuse to avoid going in the woods to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>cut timber, and the negro has always delighted
in a pretense that postpones manual
labor for him as long as possible.</p>

<p>Our work was not without its diversion.
The desire of the average boy to join the
circus is, of course, universal, but in the
young countryman this desire seems greater.
Many of them wanted to become &#8220;actors,&#8221;
as they called the acrobats. This caused
us to fix up a scheme by which we sold the
ambitious youngsters a liniment to make
them limber. It was made from cheap
grease, and was sold more for a joke than
anything else. There were always many
young men who wanted to be clowns.
They, too, bought the grease, which was
supposed to have every known physical
power.</p>

<p>It was a clean, free life in which the
hardships were soon forgotten.</p>

<h2>IV<br /><br />

I TELL ABOUT CLOWN TRICKS</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><big>HAT</big> was the great clown era in
America. Clowning reached a golden
age which passed away, never to return
again. You may not think so, but we
clowns have as much pride in our profession
as the most finished Shakespearian
actor has in his. It thrills me now to think
of the giants of those days, at whose feet I
worshiped, and from whose art I drew
inspiration. They were all white-faced
clowns, but the drollest fun-makers the
world ever saw.</p>

<p>The greatest clown America ever saw was
Dan Rice. His very name brings back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
memories of notable sawdust triumphs. He
began by running a puppet show in Reading,
Pa. Then he had a trained pig. With
this he took up clowning. He was a wonderful
rider and was equaled in daring by
one man only, and that man was James
Robinson, perhaps the most marvelous
equestrian that the United States has yet
produced. Dan was a real character in and
out of the ring. At one time he had what
was known in those days as a &#8220;river show.&#8221;
He was a good negro minstrel, and took
part in the performance. It was given in
a &#8220;Palace Boat,&#8221; fitted up as an opera
house. It was towed by a big tug, in which
the performers ate and slept. Many of
the circuses traveled in this way, making
fast at the levees each day to give their performances.
They were very popular up
and down the Mississippi. Rice could do
everything that went to amuse the circus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
crowd. At one time he earned $1,000 a
week, and for one season Adam Forepaugh
paid him a salary of $27,000. He rose to
great affluence, for at one time he owned
the Walnut Street Theater in Philadelphia.
He had a big tent circus on the road, too.
He was of a generous and noble nature;
his courage was Spartan, and he was greatly
beloved. He would face an angry crowd
without flinching, and his name was a household
word for young and old. Yet he died
in poverty, in a little house on Twenty-third
Street in New York. With him perished
part of our art.</p>

<p>A close rival to Dan Rice was George L.
Fox, who was called the &#8220;Grimaldi of
America.&#8221; Grimaldi was the great English
clown. With Fox the art of pantomime
reached its greatest perfection in this
country. He was the original &#8220;Humpty
Dumpty,&#8221; and played this part nearly two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
thousand times in New York alone. His
drollery was irresistible, and he counted
among his admirers the Booths and
all the other great tragedians of the
day.</p>

<p>Then there was &#8220;Daddy&#8221; Rice, who was
no kin to Dan, and such great clowns as
Joe Pentland, Johnny Patterson, Billy
Wallett, Dan Gardner, John Gossin,
Charles Seeley, John Lalow, Billy Burke,
father of Billie Burke the actress, &#8220;Whimsical&#8221;
Walker, and last, but not least, Al
Miaco, who is still traveling with us. He
was a real king&#8217;s jester, and wore cap and
bells. He knows more lines of Shakespeare
than most students, and to-day he reads
Ben Jonson and Byron under the tent flaps,
while waiting for his turn. He is one of the
few survivals of the good old days, for he
was, and still is, a real artist. In pantomime
he is to-day unexcelled. Miaco is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
nearly seventy, yet he can twist his foot
around his neck with the ease and agility
of a youngster. With all his wealth of
learning and his remarkable knowledge of
books, he is a white-faced clown; he makes
grimaces at the people every day, and he is
glad he is doing it.</p>

<p>The great clowns of that day were also
great comedians. If you had put them on
the stage of regular theaters&#8212;&#8220;hall shows,&#8221;
as we call them&#8212;they would have succeeded,
simply because they knew how to make fun
in a simple, natural way. Transplant a
stage comedian to the circus, and the
chances are that he will fail. He creates
a fun that is artificial.</p>

<p>It makes me laugh now to think of the
successful clown tricks of those old days.
One of the best known was called the
&#8220;Peter Jenkins Act,&#8221; so named because a
clown named Peter Jenkins first did it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
The ringmaster and the clown came into the
ring and faced the crowd. The former then
made this announcement:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ladies and gentlemen: I have the great
pleasure to announce the appearance of
Mademoiselle La Blanche, the world&#8217;s most
daring and renowned equestrienne, in her
marvelous and sensational bareback act as
performed before all the crowned heads of
Europe.&#8221;</p>

<p>A magnificent horse was led in by a
groom. He was always a superb animal, a
real leader of the &#8220;resin back&#8221; herd. The
horses used for bareback riding are called
&#8220;resin backs,&#8221; because you spread resin on
their backs in order to hold the rider&#8217;s feet
firmly. After the horse had pranced around
the ring several times a commotion was
heard in the &#8220;pad room,&#8221; the tent where the
trappings are put on the horses. It is just
outside the main tent. An attendant rushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
in and whispered something in the ringmaster&#8217;s
ear. He seemed much shocked,
and then, with some hesitation, proceeded to
make the following statement:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very sorry, ladies and gentlemen,
to be obliged to announce that Mademoiselle
La Blanche has been kicked by
a horse on her way to the arena, and is so
badly hurt that she is unable to appear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course a murmur of disappointment always
ran around through the crowd. A
moment later a seedily dressed man arose
from a seat among the spectators. He
seemed to be partially under the influence of
liquor. He shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;This show is a fake. I came here to
see that lady ride, and I won&#8217;t be humbugged.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this, he started for the ring, reeling
as he made his precarious way down the
blue seats. At the same time he carried on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
a running conversation with the ringmaster.
Everybody in the big tent became interested
in the little drama that developed, for
they thought it was the real thing.</p>

<p>As the drunken man crossed the hippodrome
track, and neared the ringmaster,
he again upbraided him. Then the ringmaster
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to be so smart, I suppose
you think <i>you</i> can ride.&#8221; The horse had
remained in the ring all the while.</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet I can,&#8221; replied the stranger,
and started for the horse.</p>

<p>The ringmaster tried to restrain him,
saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;That horse is dangerous. I warn you
that you will be hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the man ignored the warning. He
took off his coat, still giving every appearance
of intoxication. Then he laboriously
climbed on the back of the horse. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
crowd watched the performance with growing
intensity. Many stood on their seats;
all thought some accident would ensue.
Nearly every person who goes to a circus
expects something to happen that is not
down on the bills. They want the lion
tamer to be bitten by a fierce beast, or to
see an acrobat fall to the ground. I suppose
it is human nature.</p>

<p>At any rate, the drunken man finally
got on the horse, pulled a bottle from his
pocket, took a farewell swig, and then
lurched forward as if he only maintained
his position with the greatest effort. Meanwhile
the horse had started. As he trotted
the man&#8217;s clothes began to fall away from
him. In a moment he stood revealed,
clad in tights and spangles, and a noble
and commanding figure. The ringmaster&#8217;s
whip cracked, the horse began to gallop
and lo, the erstwhile drunkard proved him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>self
to be a graceful and accomplished
rider. Then the crowd saw that it had been
tricked, but it was so well done that it
invariably burst into applause, and the act
became a great success. It took a good
clown to do this, because he had to be, first
of all, a fine bareback rider. I was the
second clown in this many times. It was
my job to play with the horse while the
ringmaster and the rider were having their
conversation.</p>

<p>There was still another very successful
clown trick then. It was called the &#8220;January
Act.&#8221; From the beginning of the
American circus, the mule driven by the
clown has been called &#8220;January.&#8221; I never
knew just why or how he got this peculiar
name, save that the animal looked like the
dead of winter, and always got his tail
tied up in the reins. The trick was
this:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>The clown drove into the ring in a red
cart drawn by the mule. He drew up with
a clatter, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoa, January!&#8221;</p>

<p>The magic in this very exclamation was
amazing. No matter where spoken, in
town or in country, before great and small,
it always drew tumultuous applause. After
his noisy entrance the clown got into an
argument with the ringmaster, who had a
fine horse at his side. The clown wanted
to make a trade, which was agreed upon,
but no sooner did the ringmaster try to
move the mule than the animal became
balky, and would not budge. Meanwhile
the clown drove off in triumph with his
horse. The ringmaster, failing to move the
mule, called to the clown to come back, but
the funny man treated his plea with contempt,
while the crowd roared with laughter.
The ringmaster, in a last entreaty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>yelled that the clown could have a cash
bonus if he would only take his mule away.
This, of course, brought the clown back.
In a moment old January was hitched up
to the clown wagon, and the clown drove
off, waving his money and saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easy when you know how.&#8221;
This always caught the crowd, for everybody
is interested in a horse trade, and
especially a trade in which one of the
parties gets much the worst of the deal.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="center">&#8220;TO BE A SUCCESSFUL CLOWN YOU HAD ALSO TO BE A
GOOD PANTOMIMIST.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>In 1889 I went with the Ringling circus,
and I have been with it ever since. It was
their last year as a wagon show, for the next
year it became a railroad show, and went
from town to town on trains. Somehow I
did not like the change at first. I had
become so accustomed to the wagon traveling
at night, to the wild, free, clean
abandon of the life, that I did not fancy
the idea of sleeping on a stuffy train, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
smoke and cinders to bother me. Many of
the other circus people felt the same way
about it. The wagon life may have been
hard traveling, but it was in the open.
God&#8217;s air and sunshine were about you always,
and although it rained and blew
sometimes, the discomfort was not for
long. It kept everybody sound and
healthy. Many a millionaire would envy
the appetites and health we enjoyed. And
yet, in a way, our life was one of more
or less constant hazard.</p>

<p>There was one big satisfaction about the
change to the railroad shows. The circus
remained under canvas. Strange as it may
seem to an outsider, we can work better
under canvas than any other place. This
is true all up and down the circus line, from
the highest priced &#8220;kinker,&#8221; as the performers
are called, down to the cheapest
&#8220;rough neck,&#8221; as the canvas men are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
known. They would rather get soaked to
the skin under the &#8220;big canvas top&#8221; out
on a North Dakota prairie than be dry
under the roof of Madison Square Garden
in New York City.</p>

<p>Of course the circus had been getting
bigger all the time. Originally it was a
one-ring affair. But the competition in the
show business stimulated the various showmen
to get new and greater attractions.
The one-ring show became a two-ring show,
and this in turn became the &#8220;monster three-ring
aggregation of mastodonic amusement
creations,&#8221; such as is now billed throughout
the length and breadth of the
land.</p>

<p>As the circus grew bigger, the talking
clown ceased to exist. It was only natural
that this end of his work should be eliminated.
The tents became so large, the
arena area so extended, that it was with dif<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>ficulty
that anyone could be heard in the
seats. Besides, so many things were going
on at the same time that the clown had to
perform with his hands and legs in order to
attract any attention at all.</p>

<p>With all the innovations that have come
to the aid of the modern circus, such
monstrosities as &#8220;the dip of death&#8221; in a
somersaulting automobile, and various other
freakish inventions calculated to divert the
mind and thrill the young, the clown remains,
and always will remain, the really
picturesque and permanent feature of the
circus business. Like the brook in the
poem that the English poet wrote about,
he shall go on forever.</p>

<p>But the clown has had to keep pace with
the development of the circus. The average
person who watches a group of clowns disporting
themselves in the ring, and is
amused at their grotesque antics, may think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
it is silly and easy work. Let him try it,
and he will soon find out what hard work
it is, and what careful thought is necessary
for each act. Every act that is done must
be carefully rehearsed. I have practiced
on a trick fall for a whole month.</p>

<p>You may have noticed that clowns travel
in pairs and trios. This is due to the fact
that every clown act, no matter how ludicrous,
or how simple, must tell a story. It
is really a small comedy or a slight drama.
We must not only have action, but something
to suggest an incident or a series of
incidents. If the clowns, for example, wear
soldier uniforms, their act must give a hint
of a camp, a battlefield, or some other
definite martial picture. It may be hugely
grotesque, but it must be a concrete picture
just the same.</p>

<p>Like everything else in this busy world,
clowning must be timely. We play on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
vogues. It may be Salome, or The Merry
Widow, or Roosevelt&#8217;s trip to Africa, or
the airship. The good clown must make his
act a perfect piece of mimicry. This is
the first and foremost requirement. This
is why so many good clowns are such fine
pantomimists. We must, in short, first see
ourselves as others see us.</p>

<p>Many people wonder why we keep the
white make-up. This is the traditional
clown face, and has been so for many generations
of clowns. Both the costume and
the face have undergone little change
within my lifetime. It is perhaps the
only amusement that has maintained its
physical integrity through many years.
Take the slap-stick, the bladder, and the
funny fall, and you have the clown&#8217;s sole
stock in trade for decades. Unless I am
much mistaken, they will remain so for another
hundred years.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i095.jpg" width="400" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="center">&#8220;EVERY CLOWN ACT MUST TELL A STORY.&#8221;</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>Some very successful clown tricks are
mere accidents. You start out to do an
act, stump your toe or slip up. Then
everybody laughs, for they think it is part
of the show. Thereafter, every time you
go out to do this act you stump your toe
or slip up. With all these aids, some men
work for years at clowning, and never become
clowns. Good clowns are born, not
made.</p>

<p>The clown&#8217;s costume requires much
thought and study. Although most clowns
look alike to you, if you will watch their
attire carefully you will see that each one
is slightly different from the other. I
have little patience with the many contrivances
that some modern clowns use, such as
guns, electrical appliances, and all that sort
of thing. To be a real clown you only
need your wits and a few simple things.
The dullard clown seeks to make up for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
his mental deficiencies with mechanical contrivances.
Perhaps I am prejudiced in
favor of the old ways, just as I cling to the
memory of the old days. But they are the
best.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<h2>V<br /><br />

I LEARN ABOUT LIFE</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> <big>HAVE</big> rambled along, talking about
my profession and the things that have
happened in it, until now I realize that I
have not touched upon some events which
meant a good deal to me personally. A
clown, despite the general impression, is a
real human being. He has emotions like
any other mortal, and sometimes they are
deeper and truer than in those who pretend
to piety and keep a straight face.</p>

<p>Although we are nomads, we people of
the circus have hearts. It was shortly after
I came to America that I first saw the
woman who was to play, for a time, such
an important part in my life. I had just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
joined the Burr Robbins show, and I was
a struggling young clown in a strange
land. I did not even know all the people
in the show. My life had been so hard and
fast that I had had no time to think of
romance.</p>

<p>One day as I walked from the pad room
to the entrance to the main tent, waiting
for my time to go on, I saw a young
woman in tights and ruffled skirts, standing
with a whip in her hand. She, too, was
waiting her turn. She was lithe, slender,
and graceful, and she had the most wonderful
eyes I had ever seen. Something rose
in my throat and a keen, swift feeling ran
through me. I had never anywhere beheld
anyone who had impressed me in just
that way. As she stood there, full of life
and animation, the very embodiment of
grace and beauty, I realized that she
wielded a fascination for me that was irre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>sistible.
I watched her as she made her
entry. When she walked she was the very
poetry of motion; her bow to the crowd
was airy, and when she leaped to the back
of a noble white horse, she seemed like a
bird. I stood at the entrance transfixed.
She seemed the most exquisite rider I had
ever seen. I forgot my cue, and one of my
fellow-clowns had to shake me by the
shoulder and say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Wake up, Jules.&#8221;</p>

<p>That afternoon I stumbled through my
work. I was so slow that the ringmaster
touched me up with his whip. I could not
keep my eyes off that rider. When she
was in the ring the whole tent seemed to be
flooded with sunshine, and when she left it,
amid a tumult of applause, it seemed bare
and desolate.</p>

<p>Day after day I watched her in silent
admiration. Once I picked up courage to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
speak to her. The informality of circus life
requires no introductions among its people.
She seemed to be very proud and haughty,
and treated my advance with disdain. Yet
I always made it a point to be at the
entrance when she went on, and I watched
for her when she came out. While she
was in the ring I could scarcely work.</p>

<p>I never realized how deeply I cared for
her until I saw her talking to the head
of our principal trapeze family. He was
a splendid-looking Frenchman, with brown
hair and curled mustache, and he had a
dashing air. He got a big salary, was
featured in all the bills, and quite naturally
my lady smiled upon him. But I loved
on in silence, and in pain, covering it all
with the clown&#8217;s fool garb.</p>

<p>Can you imagine how I felt as I stood
apart each day, watching this glorious
creature laughing and making merry with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
a handsome rival? It was just like a scene
in a French book that I had read when I
was a boy at the Circus Francisco in Paris.
I little dreamed then that it would happen
to me.</p>

<p>One day I gave her some flowers that I
had bought on a hot, dusty trip downtown.
She accepted them with a sort of condescension,
and then turned quickly away,
for the French acrobat happened along, and
she beamed on him.</p>

<p>This ordeal was not pleasant. It got on
my nerves, and interfered with my work.
I had always been sunny and smiling, and
my unfailing good cheer had often helped
to drive care away from my colleagues. I
grew sad and irritable.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Jules?&#8221; they all
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;He must be in love,&#8221; said the contortionist,
banteringly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>Full many a jest is spoken in earnest,
and I realized it that day. All the while we
were traveling in the South. The weather
was very hot and there had been a good
deal of rain. Often the lot on which we
showed was damp. I caught cold, fever
developed, and I had to go to bed. But I
stayed with the show. As I lay in my
berth I dreamed, as all young lovers dream,
that some day this beautiful bareback rider,
hearing of my illness, would come to see me
on our car; that she would lean over me
with a wondrous smile on her face and say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Jules, forgive me. I have cared for
you always, and now I shall never leave
you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>One night, when I dreamed this very
vividly, I woke with a start to find the
moon shining in my face, and the car rattling
over a long bridge. I was alone.</p>

<p>I got well, and took up my clowning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
again. The first day I was back in harness
I went to my accustomed place, where so
often I had seen the bareback lady. My
heart was in my eyes, and they looked for
one thing. But I did not see her. I went
on for my first turn, with my mind all in
a whirl. When I got back to the dressing-room
I asked the boss clown about
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph,&#8221; he said, and shrugged his
shoulders. &#8220;That woman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; I replied, growing indignant.</p>

<p>&#8220;The less you ask about her the better,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Simply this,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;at Shreveport,
last week, she skipped the show, and
eloped with the hotel manager. She has a
husband and two kids in Canada.&#8221; After
a pause he added:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good riddance, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a great shock to me. It seemed
as if the ground had been cut away from
my feet. I felt a pain in my heart, and
stumbled over to my trunk and sat down.
My temple of romance had come toppling
down. I had been terribly disillusioned.
But I said to myself:</p>

<p>&#8220;Brace up, Jules. There are plenty of
other women in the world.&#8221; And I braced
up.</p>

<p>I must say right here, in defense of the
women of the circus, that the type I have
just described is a very rare one. The
women who work under the canvas are
brave, loyal, and moral. Inured to physical
hardship, and accustomed to meet all
kinds of emergencies, they well know how
to combat life&#8217;s cares. They are the gentlest
of wives, the tenderest of mothers, and
the best of comrades.</p>

<p>That early sentimental experience made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
a slight impress on me, I am glad to say.
I was young and full of life. Some years
later, when I was playing in a winter
show in the West, I met a strong and noble
woman. We became great friends. She
was not of the circus, but had many friends
in the profession. The next year I went
back and married her. She has been my
mate ever since, and each winter I go back
to her to find a tender welcome and a heart
filled with affection. Were it not for her
I might to-day be a wanderer on the face
of the earth.</p>

<p>They say a clown is a jester and has
no soul. I will tell you of an incident in
my own life. One of the joys that my
home had given me was a little boy. I was
away with the circus when he came into
the world, and I recall how impatient I was
for the end of the season to come, so I
could go to him. We became great pals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
this little chap and I. I called him Jules,
and I wanted him to be a great circus performer.
I had to be away from him all
summer, but in November, when the show
went into winter quarters at Baraboo, I
hurried back to him. The family lived in
New York then. I watched his little muscles
develop. I would dress up in my
clown clothes for him, go through all my
stunts, and he had enchanted hours. He
was the delight of my life.</p>

<p>One year the show opened very early.
We were playing in a small Wisconsin
town. It was a one-night stand, and the
big tent was full. I had a brand-new act,
and it was very funny. In it I carried a
rag baby around in my arms. I was supposed
to be taking it away from the nurse.
After I had been out on the track for a
little while, a clown came up and told me I
was wanted in the pad room. When I got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
there I was handed a telegram from my
wife. It read:</p>

<p>&#8220;Jules is dying.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was in New York; I was hundreds
of miles away, and I could not go to him.
The dearest thing in all the world to me
was slipping away. Outside in the big
tent the band was playing; whips were
cracking; people were laughing; the whole
circus fun was on. There I stood in fool&#8217;s
garb, with the hot tears streaming down my
make-up. I heard a voice say merrily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Jules, we&#8217;re waiting for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>So I had to go out into that crowded
arena with a breaking heart, and disport
myself that the mob might laugh&#8212;playing
with a dummy child while my own lay
dying.</p>

<p>Can you wonder, then, that behind the
jest of the clown there is often the pang
of pain, the sear of sorrow? I have many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
chances to look into the heart of the circus,
because I am the postman. I go down to
the post-office in every town, and I bring
out the mail. I know every performer by
name, and I am the agent that brings joy
or ache. Many eager hopes hang on those
post-office trips of mine. The dashing bareback
ladies and the daring trapeze performers
look for letters that never come.
Human nature is the same the world over,
whether it is in the gilded palace or under
the canvas of the big tent.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i111.jpg" width="400" height="559" alt="" />
<p class="center">&#8220;I BECOME THE FRIEND AND CONFIDANT OF ALL.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>I send away the money orders for all the
performers, and in this way I find out some
of their secrets. The gruff strong man,
whose giant muscles are the admiration of
the crowd, sends part of his wages each
week to his old mother in Germany; the
bewildering little rider, who moves in a gay
world of motion and color, has a sick husband,
whom she supports. I become the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>friend and confidant of all of them, and
it makes life richer and deeper and more
worth while for me.</p>

<p>I have seen many things in my circus day
to wring the heart. I told you of my own
great sorrow. It reminds me of a sort of
kindred grief that came to my old friend
Garrett. He was one of the best fellows
that ever lived, an Irishman of the real
sort, and a good clown. Many a time we
worked together in the sawdust. He married
a very pretty slack-wire performer,
named Dottie. She was a very lovable
little thing, and everybody in the circus
liked her. One night Garrett and I were
working on the track, and Dottie had gone
up for her act. We made merry as we
went, and kept the crowd in a roar of
laughter.</p>

<p>All of a sudden I heard a scream, but
kept right on with my work. It is part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
the unwritten rule of circus business to
ignore fear and panic. So we kept on.
But a curious hush fell on the crowd. I
turned, and there on the middle stage I
saw a group standing about a huddled
figure. A man came rushing from the pad
room, and I saw it was our doctor. By
that time Garrett had turned, too. I saw
his face turn ghastly, even under the white
make-up. He gave a moan, and dashed
over to the platform. There he found
his wife dead. She had fallen from the
wire and there was no net beneath.</p>

<p>Gently he picked her up, and carried her
away, sobbing out his heart over her tinseled
dress. But in a moment the music
struck up, the whips cracked, and the circus
was going again.</p>

<h2>VI<br /><br />

I RELATE SOME CLOWN HISTORY</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">M</span><big>ANY</big> people think that because the
clown wears a grotesque garb and
indulges in silly antics, that he is a buffoon
all the time. They are very much mistaken.
Like humorists, we take our profession very
seriously, for it has traditions of real greatness.</p>

<p>I never quite understood this so much
until I had an experience in Boston. We
usually stay there a week, and this gives
us a chance to get around and see the city.
One hot June afternoon I was taking a
street-car ride out towards the suburbs. It
was so sultry that few people were stirring.
For a time I had the car all to myself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
Then a very dignified old gentleman came
aboard and sat down next to me. We rode
on in silence for a time until I made some
remark about the weather. I am inclined
to be friendly. We got to talking. Finally
he asked me what my business was.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a circus clown,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>He looked amazed. Then wiped his
glasses, gazed at me, and remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s extraordinary. I thought you were
a minister.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps the white string necktie that I
always wear fooled him, as it has fooled
many other people. They seem to think
that a clown should be grinning all the
time or ready to turn a somersault.</p>

<p>I found the old gentleman very entertaining.
He said a little later on:</p>

<p>&#8220;My friend, your profession is a thousand
years old, and you may well be proud
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>This interested me immensely, and I
asked him to tell me where I could find out
some facts about its origin.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will read your Roman history
you will find much to enlighten you about
the beginning of your work.&#8221; Then he told
me that he was a professor at Harvard,
and soon after he left the car.</p>

<p>The next day I went down to the Boston
Public Library and got some Roman histories.
Although I found nothing about
clowns, there was a great deal about pantomime,
which I have always held was the
real forerunner of clowning. Pantomime
dates back to the Jews and early Egyptians.
The early Greek drama partook of
it, and it was introduced into Rome during
the reign of the Emperor Augustus.
M&aelig;cenas, Virgil, Horace, and Ovid, and
other great literary men of the period, enjoyed
the work of the pantomimists. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
early pantomimes, so I discovered, expressed
love or the exploits of the gods and
goddesses. At one time the Romans went
mad on the subject of pantomimes. Nero
was one of the most ardent patrons. When
he asked Demetrius what gift he most
wanted, that worthy answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;A pantomime, because it needs no interpreter.&#8221;.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i119.jpg" width="500" height="345" alt="" />
<p class="center">&#8220;TO BE A GOOD CLOWN A MAN MUST BE A STUDENT AND IN EARNEST.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The pantomimist spoke a universal language,
because he talked with his hands.
The Roman pantomimist worked in the
great open-air theaters, and also in the
homes of the rich. In the latter places he
was called upon to carve the meats, which
he did with many flourishes. Thus he made
himself both useful and ornamental. In
later years, however, I might add that the
clown has lost his ornamental features.
The Roman pantomime died with the
decay of Roman glory, and it was not until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>the fifteenth century that it was revived in
Italy</p>

<p>Then it was that the original predecessor
of the clown of to-day made his appearance
in rude plays in the character known
as Arlecchino, who was a blundering servant.
Originally he combined loutishness
with great cunning. Out of this name
developed the word Harlequin, which became
very popular in France. The Harlequin
wore a black mask, had a cocked hat,
and wielded a bat. This bat was the original
of the modern slap-stick so much used
by clowns and low comedians.</p>

<p>As the pantomime developed, Harlequin
surrounded himself with characters. Of
course there had to be a woman, so she was
introduced in the shape of a pretty servant,
who wore tights. She was Colombine.
The girl had to have a father, so he became
Pantaloon, who wore baggy trousers. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
fourth figure was also needed. Here is
where the first real clown came in. He was
the servant to Harlequin. He, too, wore
baggy trousers, had a peaked hat, and was
supposed to be always getting into trouble.
You can now see the connection between
Harlequin&#8217;s clown and the circus clown of
to-day.</p>

<p>Pantomime found its greatest vogue in
England, where it was introduced early in
the eighteenth century at the Covent Garden
Theater. A manager named Rich first
brought it out. He devised a pantomime
play in which Harlequin appeared as the
lover of Colombine. Her father (Pantaloon)
opposed the match; thereupon Harlequin
abducted her, with the aid of the
clown. The clown introduced many ludicrous
effects.</p>

<p>The pantomime plays grew into tremendous
popularity in England. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
were given at the holiday season before
immense crowds. The greatest managers
found them necessary to good business.
Even Garrick became sponsor for it. It
was he who introduced Signor Giuseppe
Grimaldi, father of the &#8220;Immortal Joe,&#8221;
the greatest clown the world has ever
known. I am proud to belong to the profession
that Grimaldi adorned. The father
played Harlequin for a long time in the
London pantomimes. Joe early appeared
with his parent. His first part was as
monkey, when he was three years old. He
was attached to a chain, and his father used
to whirl him around by this chain. Once
the chain broke, and little Joe landed on the
stomach of a stout gentleman who sat in
the front row.</p>

<p>When Joe grew up he abandoned the
Harlequin part, and became the clown.
He took off the spangles and fancy colored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
diamonds that were always a part of the
Harlequin costume, and dressed in white
with pantaloon trousers. He whitened his
face, and then put on patches of red. He
looked more like a lubberly boy, who had
been caught eating jam.</p>

<p>With the ascendency of Joe Grimaldi
the clown took precedence over Harlequin,
and has had it ever since. But it was due
to Joe&#8217;s great genius. He was called
&#8220;The Garrick of Clowns.&#8221; His first triumphs
were in &#8220;Mother Goose.&#8221; He did
not depend upon acrobatic feats for his success,
but on genuine humor. His antics
were side-splitting. He became a national
figure. Lord Byron was his friend, and
Charles Dickens used to come to see him
each week. Later, Dickens edited his
Memoirs, which I regard as a remarkable
tribute to a clown&#8217;s thoughts. When
Grimaldi was out of the cast all London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
sulked. He was as necessary to Covent
Garden as was the great John Kemble himself.
Yet he was only a clown.</p>

<p>It is said of Grimaldi that he felt his
work so keenly that as soon as his performance
was over, he retired to a corner and
wept profusely. He was a man of tender
heart and generous impulses. There is a
story about him which has been handed
down by many generations of clowns. It
goes on to say that once Grimaldi became
very ill and despondent. He went to consult
a great London specialist. The great
man looked him over, and then remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to see Grimaldi, and laugh yourself
well.&#8221;</p>

<p>The clown looked at him sadly, and
replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Grimaldi.&#8221;</p>

<p>The art of exquisite clown fooling died
in England when Grimaldi passed away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
The London managers had to create a substitute,
which they did after a fashion, with
elaborate scenic spectacles. The clowns
that followed were acrobats. Agility took
the place of humor. There are traces of
this in the clowning of to-day.</p>

<p>Of course, in any consideration of the
origin of the modern clown you must
reckon with the king&#8217;s jester. You have
only to turn to the pages of Shakespeare
to find how highly he was regarded. Every
court had its fool, and he was often the
wise man. In King Lear are the words:</p>

<p class="center">
&#8220;<i>Jesters do oft prove prophets.</i>&#8221;
</p>

<p>Jacques was a philosopher, and Touchstone
a great personage.</p>

<p>I have known king&#8217;s jesters in the American
circus, but their art was too fine to be
appreciated by the multitudes, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
had to give way to the more popular form
of clowning. It took years of thought and
study to be a Shakespearian jester.</p>

<p>Although the historical facts about the
origin of the clown are fine and imposing,
I somehow prefer to remember the legend
about it that I heard as a boy in France.
It was told me by an old clown in Normandy.
As he related it to me, it went on
to show that the little daughter of a wandering
mountebank once dreamed that she
saw her father with whitened face, peaked
hat, and baggy white pantaloons, performing
before a great crowd, and that everybody
was laughing and applauding. It was
such a vivid dream that she told her father
about it. He was deeply impressed, and
adopted the costume, thus appearing as the
first white-faced clown.</p>

<h2>VII<br /><br />

I GIVE MY CREED</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">F</span><big>OR</big> thousands of years man has
searched for the Fountain of Youth,
and it has always eluded him. Yet I am
foolish enough to think that I have discovered
it. The secret lies in being a clown.
We are not only the oldest people of the
circus in tradition, but also in years. There
is that about our work which keeps us
eternally young in spirit. Sometimes when
the journey has been long and the day hot
and the dust thick, I get a little weary, for
I am moving on towards sixty. But as
soon as I hear the music of the band, the
snorts of the horses, the shrill voices of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
&#8220;barkers,&#8221; and the indescribable movement
of the crowd toward the big tent, it
all acts like wine upon my blood. I am
stirred to action, the weariness falls away
like magic, and I am young again. I
have not missed a performance in five
years.</p>

<p>Many performers in the circus have this
same experience, but the clown has a deeper
and truer inspiration behind his. It lies in
laughter. We make people laugh and we
get, in a curious way, the effect of that
laughter on ourselves. Laughter looses the
fetters of the brain, and it radiates a spirit
that makes for the joyousness of life. Combined
with it is our constant action in the
open air. No man who keeps his body and
mind active, and who lives temperately in
the fresh air, will grow &#8220;old&#8221; as the world
sees age. This is why I say that I have
found the Fountain of Youth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps by this time you may wonder
what a clown&#8217;s state of mind is. If I have
succeeded in giving any hint of the real
mood of my profession, you will know that
it is seriousness. Hence the clown&#8217;s outlook
on life is grave. It takes a wise man to be
a fool. Therefore anybody cannot play the
clown. It is only in external things that
we are &#8220;comical fellows.&#8221; There are good
and bad clowns, clowns with high ideals,
and those who regard clowning merely as a
means towards earning a livelihood. Of
course, clowns, like poets, must be fed, but
there is a right way to approach one&#8217;s calling
and a wrong way. To be a good clown
a man must be a student and be in earnest.</p>

<p>I read books every chance I get. It will
not surprise you perhaps when I say that
one of my favorites is &#8220;Don Quixote.&#8221;
Somewhere in this great work Sancho
Panza says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;In comedy the most difficult character
is that of the fool, and he that plays the
part must be no simpleton.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wise old Sancho was right. It fits into
my theory of clowning perfectly.</p>

<p>I have read every one of Charles Dickens&#8217;
books. This is not because the Immortal
Boz was the friend and editor of Grimaldi,
the king of clowns, but because it always
seems to me that he knew how to analyze
the human heart. He knew the lowly. I
like history, too, and once in a while, when
I want to be stirred deeply, I read about
Napoleon. I think he was a very wicked
man, but I have French blood in me, and
I suppose it is pride in him, after all, that
makes me admire him. I have left for the
last the book that has influenced me more
than all others, and this is the Bible. The
world never associates a white-faced clown
with piety. I don&#8217;t profess to be pious, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
I love to read the Bible. Sometimes on the
long, hot Sunday afternoons I lie under a
tent flap and read it to the men. The
roughest canvas man will respect a man
who is sincerely good, but he has a profound
contempt for the pretender.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<p class="center">&#8220;I HAVE MADE COUNTLESS CHILDREN CLAP THEIR LITTLE
HANDS WITH GLEE.&#8221;</p></div>


<p>Since I have gotten into a reflective mood
I should like to say something about the
work of a clown that I don&#8217;t think the average
person who goes to the circus comprehends,
and it is this: the clown&#8217;s art has
endured through all the years because it is
clean. This is a very simple but a very
powerful reason. Amusement vogues come
and go, for the taste of the man who wants
to be diverted is fickle. He is always craving
something new. He may be interested for
a brief time in the sickly atmosphere of a
problem or an erotic play, but he soon tires
of it. So with many other forms of entertainment.
The vaudeville which is now hav<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>ing
its hour of glory will pass away. But
clowning is done out in the open air, where
the winds of heaven blow about you! It
is clean, morally and physically. It has no
ambition to appeal to the senses; it has no
elevating purpose; its sole idea is to
amuse. In this it has achieved permanency.</p>


<p>Perhaps nothing in all my long antic
before the public has given me a keener
pleasure than the realization that I have
given delight to children. The sight of
their little faces, beaming with happiness
and stretching up, row behind
row, to the very top of the seats, has always
filled me with renewed zeal for my
work.</p>

<p>Nothing so attracts the small boy as the
circus. I have strained my conscience many
a time by letting a ragged urchin slip under
the canvas and get a seat in the cherished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
paradise. This reminds me of an incident
that always gives me satisfaction to rehearse.</p>

<p>Eighteen years ago the Ringling show
was at Binghamton, N. Y. It was a very
hot day, and I stood outside the dressing
tent to get a breath of air. As I stood
there a little boy came up and eyed me
eagerly. I was dressed for the afternoon
performance, and thought he was merely
staring at me out of boyish curiosity. Then
I saw tears and a very wistful look in his
eyes. I have always loved children, and this
little chap made me think of my own dead
boy. I walked up to him, and putting my
hand on his head, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, sonny?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to see the circus,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you no money?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he replied, and fell to weeping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>Something in the lad&#8217;s manner touched
me deeply. I saw that he really wanted to
see the show, so I took him by the hand
and led him to where he could find his way
to a good seat. He was radiant with pleasure
as I left him.</p>

<p>The years passed, and I forgot all about
the incident. A few seasons ago we again
showed at Binghamton, N. Y. Once more
it was a scorching hot afternoon, and
curiously enough I stood outside the dressing
tent before the time came for me
to go on. A fine-looking young man
came up to where I was standing, and
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, but I am looking
for a clown who befriended me fifteen years
ago. I heard someone then call him &#8216;Jules.&#8217;
Can you tell me if he is still with the
show?&#8221;</p>

<p>I said to him:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to look far, for I am
Jules.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that he reached forward, seized
my hand and shook it warmly. Then he
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have waited a long time to thank you
for that kindness of long ago. It may have
seemed a small thing to you, but it meant
a lot to me. I want you to take dinner
with me to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>I went downtown with him after the performance,
and we had a fine talk. He had
become an electrical engineer and was doing
well. He had always missed our circus
when it showed at Binghamton. He made
me promise to send him a picture of myself.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="center">&#8220;IT IS GOOD TO BE A CLOWN.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>My life is dotted with experiences of this
kind. Can you wonder, then, that I am
proud and glad to be a clown? In one of
his plays Shakespeare says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>
&#8220;<i>It is meat and drink to see a clown.</i>&#8221;<br />
</p>

<p>I should change it so as to read:</p>

<p>
&#8220;<i>It is meat and drink</i> <span class="smcap">TO BE</span> <i>a clown.</i>&#8221;<br />
</p>

<p>I have saved my money, and I own a
house out in a Missouri town, where I
go every winter after the circus season
closes. I also have a farm in North Dakota,
where I can see green things grow. I know
that whatever may befall me I have a roof
of my own which will shelter my last years.
But I never expect to stop clowning as long
as I am able to work.</p>

<p>Since I have spoken of the origin of the
clown it might be well for me to speak of
his end. Few ever leave the circus. Once
a clown, always a clown. It is best to die
in harness.</p>

<p>I have enjoyed my clowning, and to be
content with one&#8217;s work is a great satisfac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>tion.
It does not come to all. I know
at least that I have caused many people to
forget their troubles, and I have made
countless children clap their little hands with
glee.</p>

<p>It is good to be a clown.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
